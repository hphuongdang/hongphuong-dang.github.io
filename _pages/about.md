I am currently an assistant professor at the National School of Statistics and Information Analysis ([ENSAI](http://ensai.fr){:target="\_blank"} ), member of the Center for Research in Economics and Statistics ([CREST](http://crest.science){:target="\_blank"}).


I was a PhD student from october, 2013 to november, 2016 at CRIStAL in Lille, France, under the supervision of Pierre Chainais and I was part of the SigMA group at CRIStAL.
My Ph.D. thesis is entitled " Non-parametric Bayesian approaches and dictionary learning for inverse problems in image processing".


<strong>Research interests</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Statistical signal and image processing.</li>
  <li>Inverse problems in signal and image processing.</li>
  <li>Matrix factorization.</li>
  <li>Dictionary learning, sparse representations.</li>
  <li>Classification, clustering.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Tools and methods</strong> (favorite)
<ul>
  <li>Bayesian inference, hierarchical models, latent variable models.</li>
  <li>Bayesian nonparametric.</li>
  <li>Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm.</li>
  <li>Expectation-Maximization algorithm, variational approximation.</li>
</ul>
 I am particularly interested in working on medical imaging problems.<br />
 I am also interested in interaction between Bayesian methods and optimization.
